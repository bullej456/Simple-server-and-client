# Simple-server-and-client

A simple program written in java to demonstrate one server communicating with one client.
The client will send various messages to the server and wait for a response from each one and when the "official" shutdown message is called they will both shutdown in a safe manner.
This can be extended by adding multi-threading and hence having multiple clients talk to the server at the same time.
